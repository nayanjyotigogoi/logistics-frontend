## 🔄 How Navigation Works

### From List to Detail
1. User clicks "View" (👁️) button on any row
2. Navigates to `/dashboard/[entity]/[id]`
3. Shows complete entity details
4. Shows list of child entities (if any)

### From Detail to Detail (Drill Down)
1. User clicks "View" on a child entity in the table
2. Navigates deeper: Job → Master AWB → House AWB
3. Each level shows its children
4. Breadcrumbs show the path taken

### From Detail Back Up (Breadcrumb)
1. User clicks any part of the breadcrumb
2. Instantly navigates to that level
3. Can jump multiple levels at once
4. Maintains context and state

### Cross-Navigation (Links)
1. House AWB detail shows "View Job" link
2. House AWB detail shows "View Master AWB" link
3. Click link to jump to related entity
4. Allows quick navigation across hierarchy

## 📊 Data Flow

### API Integration
All pages use Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query) for data fetching:

```typescript
// Jobs
useGetJobsQuery({ page, limit, search })
useGetJobByIdQuery(jobId)

// Master AWBs  
useGetMasterAwbsQuery({ page, page_size })
useGetMasterAwbByIdQuery(masterAwbId)
useSearchMasterAwbsQuery({ job_id, page, page_size })

// House AWBs
useGetHouseAwbsQuery({ page, limit, search })
useGetHouseAwbByIdQuery(houseAwbId)
useSearchHouseAwbsQuery({ master_id, page, page_size })
```

### Relationship Structure
```typescript
Job {
  job_id: string
  job_number: string
  // ... other fields
}

MasterAwb {
  master_id: string
  master_number: string
  job_id: string          // ← Links to Job
  job?: Job              // ← Populated by backend
  // ... other fields
}

HouseAwb {
  house_id: string
  house_number: string
  job_id: string          // ← Links to Job
  master_id?: string      // ← Optional link to Master AWB
  job?: Job              // ← Populated by backend
  master_awb?: MasterAwb // ← Populated by backend
  items?: Item[]         // ← Child items
  // ... other fields
}

Item {
  item_id: number
  house_awb_id: number    // ← Links to House AWB
  commodity_id: number
  description: string
  quantity: number
  weight: number
  volume: number
  // ... other fields
}
```
